### **THE PROBLEM**

A few renowned global brands are willing to collaborate with Smart Technologies to distribute its tech products in a new country. Smart Technologies has regional hubs in other countries for importing tech products to Bangladesh; however, they have not yet expanded their distribution operations into any foreign countries.

Smart Technologies needs to assess entry barriers, ensure compliance to protect the brand, and build a reliable partner ecosystem, while considering the political and cultural differences in potential countries to expand.
